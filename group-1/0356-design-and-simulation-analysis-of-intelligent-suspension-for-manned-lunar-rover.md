As the assembly connecting the vehicle body and wheels, the suspension takes responsibility for transmitting force, ensuring fine wheel ground adhesion, turning portability, buffering impact load and attenuating vibration. Combining the intelligent control technology of ground vehicle with the operating environment and moving characteristics of manned lunar rover, this study expounds the feasibility and necessity of applying intelligent suspension to manned lunar rover. Based on the requirements of the mobility performance, including handleability, stability, trafficability and ride comfort, a rotating electromagnetic intelligent suspension for manned lunar rover is designed. The complete suspension model is reasonably simplified and equivalent, based on the design of the intelligent suspension mechanism. We use various strategies to control the intelligent suspension for manned lunar rover, and compare the control effect. The effectiveness of the intelligent suspension for manned lunar rover is verified by using Adams and Matlab cooperative simulation. The results show that the evaluating indicators, including body acceleration, suspension dynamic displacement and tire dynamic deflection, are obviously better than the traditional passive suspension, the intelligent suspension can significantly improve the mobility performance of the manned lunar rover.
